# Day 8 – Loops in JavaScript  

## What I Learned  

- **Loops** are used to repeat code instead of writing it again and again.  
- Types of loops:  
  - **for loop** → when we know how many times to run.  
  - **while loop** → when we keep running until a condition becomes false.  
  - **do-while loop** → runs at least once, even if the condition is false.  
- **Loop control**:  
  - `break` → stops the loop immediately.  
  - `continue` → skips current iteration and goes to the next.  
- **Nested loops** → a loop inside another loop (used in tables, patterns).  
- **Infinite loop** → happens if condition never becomes false (⚠️ avoid this!).

## Mini Project – Multiplication Table & Number Analyzer  

### Features:  
1. Take a number as input.  
2. Print its multiplication table (using **for loop**).  
3. Count numbers between 1–100 divisible by that number (using **while loop**).  
4. Ask if the user wants to try again (using **do-while loop**).
