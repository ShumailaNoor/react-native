## Summary of What I Learned

During this project, I learned and practiced important CSS concepts through both theory (handwritten notes) and practical tasks:

- **CSS Basics**  
  I understood how CSS works with HTML to style web pages, how to link stylesheets, and how to apply inline, internal, and external CSS.

- **CSS Selectors**  
  I explored different types of selectors such as ID, class, group selectors, and pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:nth-child()`. I practiced applying them in a blog-style layout.

- **CSS Box Model**  
  I learned how every element in CSS is a box consisting of **content, padding, border, and margin**. I visualized how spacing works and used `box-sizing: border-box` to control element sizing.

- **CSS Flexbox**  
  I learned how to create flexible and responsive layouts using `display: flex`. I practiced properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `gap` to build a navbar and 3-column layout.
