# Day 1 – My JavaScript Learning Summary  

---

## What I Learned  

### 1. What is JavaScript?  
- JavaScript is not like HTML (structure) or CSS (styling).  
- It’s the **brain of a website** — makes things move, react, and become interactive.  
- Without JS → websites are static.  
- With JS → websites become fun (like YouTube, Instagram, Gmail).

### 2. Where Does JavaScript Run?  
- Inside every modern **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
- Browsers have a **JS engine** (Chrome uses V8).  
- I can test JS directly in the **Console tab** of Developer Tools.

### 3. The Console  
- It’s like a small **playground** for testing JS code.  
- Helps me:  
  - Write small code snippets.  
  - Debug errors.  
  - Print values and messages.

### 4. The `console.log()` Function  
- First command I learned:  
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, I am learning JavaScript!");
