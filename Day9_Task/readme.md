# Day 9 – Learning JavaScript Functions

## Learning Goals
Today I explored **functions in JavaScript** and how they help in writing reusable, organized, and cleaner code.  
I also worked on a **mini project (Student Grade Calculator)** to apply all concepts in practice.

## Topics Covered
- **Function Declaration** – Defining a function using the `function` keyword.
- **Function Expression** – Storing a function inside a variable.
- **Arrow Functions (`()=>`)** – Shorter syntax, commonly used in modern JS.
- **Parameters vs. Arguments** – Parameters are placeholders, arguments are actual values.
- **Default Parameters** – Provide a fallback value when no argument is passed.
- **Return Values** – Functions can return results instead of just printing.
- **Function Scope** – Global vs. Local variables.
- **Nested Functions** – Function inside another function.
- **Callback Functions** – Passing a function as an argument to another function.

##  Handwritten Notes Questions
1. What is a function in JavaScript? Why do we use functions?  
2. Difference between **function declaration** and **function expression**.  
3. How is an **arrow function** different from a normal function?  
4. Difference between **parameters** and **arguments**.  
5. What happens if a function doesn’t return anything?  
6. What is **function scope**? Explain with global vs. local examples.  
7. What are **callback functions** and why are they important?

## Coding Practice
- Function to calculate the **square** of a number.  
- Function that takes **two numbers** and returns the larger one.  
- Arrow function that takes a **string** and returns it in uppercase.  
- Function that takes an **array of numbers** and returns the sum.  
- Function with a **default parameter** that greets the user.  
- Function that checks if a **number is even or odd**.  
- Function that takes **another function** as a parameter and executes it.
